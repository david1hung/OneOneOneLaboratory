TODO

1. What if, for the implementation of command_stream_t, we have an additional
	line struct that looks something like (where, in this case, we write our own
	arbitrary stack classes):

		struct line {
			stack* operands;
			stack* operators;
		};

    Then make it so that the actual command_stream_t will be an array of lines?

		struct command_stream {
			line* lines;
		} stream;

	This way, we can simply use the infix algorithm to push/pop the relevant
	operands. We'll be able to check for syntax correctness when we're
	populating the two stacks, then pop them with the right indentation to
	finish off the project.
