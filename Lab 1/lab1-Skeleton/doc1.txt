David’s Principles for Life
1.	Plan adequate work for the day, and finish the work for the day. 
2.	When eagerly feeling to seek entertainment, seek for reading the Bible, the greatest book filled with joy and blessings from God. 
3.	Take notes, and read notes. Mark the happy and disappointing things in life. There are lessons to learn everywhere.
4.	Set time of relaxation, and do not relax overtime. Procrastination is a source of great stress. Reading the news is good, but reading too much is not. 
5.	Allocate more time on being productive than messing around. iPhone is not life, but time is life.
6.	Sleep before 12:00 am. The body and mind needs rest. 
7.	Do some exercise everyday. Healthier body leads to healthier mind and heart!
8.	Smile and be happy at all times! “For the Lord is always with me!”
9.	Set a dream and goal. Do everything while keeping the dream in mind, and know that every step I take will bring me closer to the dream. 
10.	Plan one-on-one time with God everyday! It is empowering and inspiring! It really helps set course on God’s purpose in my life, and keep me close to God’s heart!
11.	No gaming after dinner! It saves time and makes me more prepared for the next day!
12.	When crediting money, try to debit it on assets instead of expenses!
